# A Library of VSTs for DIY Musicians
A growing resource of plugins for DIY producers who don't want to pay for overpriced products!  All rough and ready but they do the job.
Made in C++ with JUCE
This repo is a handy collection of all the work we have done in this area - to have a dive into the source code and maybe do some mods yourself check out the source repos linked in each section.  Have fun!

## Poly Fuzz
Two fuzzes in one box.  Scoop knob, octave enabler, double-up madness.

## CABINATOR
A simple to use and lightweight cab sim.  Following the general theme this thing is extremely tweakable - an invitation to
step outside of the static historical molds.
- current version : 1.0

## Netzer JFET Overdrive
A DIY Blog inspired overdrive based on the Runoffgroove "Fezter" boost pedal.  I like it a lot, and it blows the PolyCule out of the water
- current version : 1.0

## PolyCule
A versatile overdrive with voicing parameters, clipping options and diode arrangement all built in.
This is based on some classic diode-like soft-clipping algorithms.  Its cool but I personally think the Netzer sounds better
- Current Version : 1.0
