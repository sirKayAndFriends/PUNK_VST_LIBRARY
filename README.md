# A Library of VSTs for DIY Musicians
A growing resource of plugins for DIY producers who don't want to pay for overpriced products!  All rough and ready but they do the job.
Made in C++ with JUCE
This repo is a handy collection of all the work we have done in this area - to have a dive into the source code and maybe do some mods yourself check out the source repos linked in each section.  Have fun!

## Poly Switch
An extremely fluid software amplifier with options for all sorts of voicings and characteristics.
- Current Version : 3.0

## Poly Fuzz
Two fuzzes in one box.  Scoop knob, octave enabler, double-up madness.
Looks bad but sounds good.  Enjoy the Simpsons jokes
- current version: 2.0

## CABINATOR
A simple to use and lightweight cab sim.  Following the general theme this thing is extremely tweakable - an invitation to
step outside of the static historical molds.
- current version : 1.0

## Netzer JFET Overdrive
A DIY Blog inspired overdrive based on the Runoffgroove "Fezter" boost pedal.  I like it a lot, and it blows the PolyCule out of the water
- current version : 1.0

## PolyCule
A versatile overdrive with voicing parameters, clipping options and diode arrangement all built in.
This is based on some classic diode-like soft-clipping algorithms.  Its cool but I personally think the Netzer sounds better
- Current Version : 1.0

## *Arriving Soon?*
- A back-to-basics synth intriguingly called "Geoffrey"...
- A whacky stereo glitcher / tracker
- Some ideas I have about a digital Oramatics workstation...
