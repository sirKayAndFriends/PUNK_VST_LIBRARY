# A Library of VSTs for DIY Musicians
A growing resource of plugins for DIY producers who don't want to pay for overpriced products!  All rough and ready but they do the job.
Built in PlugData and compiled to C++ with the PD Heavy Compiler then built and beautified with JUCE.  
This repo is a handy collection of all the work we have done in this area - to have a dive into the source code and maybe do some mods yourself check out the source repos linked in each section.  Have fun!

## PolyAmp
An extremely fluid software amplifier with options for all sorts of voicings and characteristics.
- Current Version : 1.0

## PolyCule
A similarly versatile overdrive with voicing parameters, clipping options and diode arrangement all built in.  It also looks nice!
- Current Version : 1.0

## NARK - BETA
A Big Muff-like fuzz.  A scoop knob allows you to choose the amount of the famous 1kHz mid-scoop or to eliminate it entirely!  There's also a button for half-wave rectification 
to get a nice octavey sound.  For hyperfuzz fans!
This is still a bit wobbly but it sounds ok.  Hopefully a final version soon!
